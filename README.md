Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Training & Monitoring Dashboard
This project provides a comprehensive dashboard to monitor the training and progress of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Virtual Reality (VR). The platform enables parents and therapists to track engagement, skill development, and behavioral insights in real time. Built with Firebase and Grafana, the system features customizable training modules, real-time data visualization, and seamless collaboration tools. Parents can view progress trends, receive actionable feedback, and personalize training based on specific goals, while therapists can adjust modules and strategies based on weekly/monthly reports. The solution leverages VR data integrated with Firestore to deliver accurate and secure analytics via an intuitive interface.
